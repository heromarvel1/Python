# Python
* Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language
* It was created by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the [ABC language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language))
* It was first released in 1991
* Python is meant to be an easily readable language
* It's formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation
* Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional
* Python 3.7 is used mostly in this repository as Python 2 was discontinued from 2020
